## Trade

Now that you have successfully connected your SOL wallet it’s time to trade. The trading experience is the same as a centralized exchange, with the same interface.

Let’s buy 10 SRM tokens at a limit price of 1.14 USDT each and make sure you approve this transaction on your [Sollet.io](https://sollet.io) popup.

Now you can see your limit buy order on the Orderbook, also in the Open Orders.

Note that cancelling your Open Orders or having the trade successfully matched and traded won’t update your wallet balance. These funds sit in an intermediary account and require you to settle them back to your own sollet wallet. You have to go to Balances to settle them back to your [Sollet.io](https://sollet.io) wallet.
